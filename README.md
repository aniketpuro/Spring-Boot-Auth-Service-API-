# 🔐 Spring Boot Auth Service API

A secure, scalable, and production-ready Authentication and Authorization API built using **Spring Boot**, designed for modern microservices architecture.  
Integrated with **DevSecOps tools** for continuous delivery and security best practices.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Token expiration and refresh
- ✅ Secure password hashing (BCrypt)
- ✅ Exception handling & validation
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with security scans
